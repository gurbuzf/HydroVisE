This page provides brief information about HydroVisE.

## **What is HydroVisE?**

HydroVisE is a client-side web browser-based software for visualization and analysis of environmental data. It is developed to facilitate visualization and basic data evaluations for users with less exposure to web programming languages.

HydroVisE is designed to address most common visualizations for environmental data with ability to further include more capabilities within its designed framework.


## **Why HydroVisE is developed?**

The rapidly growing volume of environmental data demands new tools and techniques for visualizing geospatial data in an interactive environment. The main motivation of HydroVisE is to decrease the amount of efforts.


## **Who can benefit from HydroVisE?**

Anyone interested in visualization and evaluation of their data in a web-based interactive environment (e.g. researchers and students).

## **How does HydroVisE work?**

Overall, HydroVisE uses **configuration** file provided by the user to understand the data sources, metadata, styling, and etc. But the uder does not need to understand the complexity of the internal architecture of the system. Because the config file allows user to connect data sources, control styling, etc.. Users can create different config files and re-utilize the data for different projects.

HydroVisE is a software written mainly in JavaScript, CSS(Cascading Style Sheet), HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). It leverages the most popular web technologies, tools, and libraries for visualizations. These libraries are listed and described briefly in dependencies.



## **How to use it?**

In general, **Deployment** of the code, **Data preparation** and **Configuration** are the three steps needed to use HydroVisE.

Users of the source code are strongly encouraged to review these three pages before using the code:

**1.** [**Architecture and workflow**](https://github.com/njadid/HydroVisE/wiki/Architecture-and-Workflow)

_Reason: It is important to learn HydroVisE rationale before starting to use it. This will save you significant amount of time in future usages._

**2.** [**Supported data types**](https://github.com/njadid/HydroVisE/wiki/Supported-data-types)

_Reason: Although the supported data types are among most common data types, there are requirements for data in HydroVisE._

**3.** [**Configuration**](https://github.com/njadid/HydroVisE/wiki/Configuration)

_Reason: HydroVisE configuration plays significant role in relating data to functions embedded in HydroVisE. Therefore, understanding Configuration is essential in deploying a working HydroVisE web application._
