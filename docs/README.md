This page provides brief information about HyGIS. Refer to [Wiki Page](https://github.com/njadid/HyGIS/wiki) for more information.

## **What is HyGIS?**

HyGIS is a client-side web browser-based software for visualization and analysis of environmental data. It is developed to facilitate visualization and basic data evaluations for users with less exposure to web programming languages.

HyGIS is designed to address most common visualizations for environmental data with ability to further include more capabilities within its designed framework.


## **Why HyGIS is developed?**

The rapidly growing volume of environmental data demands new tools and techniques for visualizing geospatial data in an interactive environment. The main motivation of HyGIS is to decrease the amount of efforts.


## **Who can benefit from HyGIS?**

The potential users of HyGIS are researchers, students who are working  or anyone who are interested in visualization and evaluation of their data in a web-based interactive environment.

## **How does HyGIS work?**

HyGIS is a software written mainly in JavaScript, CSS(Cascading Style Sheet), HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). It leverages the most popular web technologies, tools, and libraries for visualizations. These libraries are listed and described briefly in dependencies.

Overall, HyGIS uses **configuration** file provided by the user to understand the data sources, metadata, styling, and etc. This capability allows users to create multiple applications by different configuration files.

## **How to use it?**

In general, **Data preparation**, **Configuration**, and **Deployment** are the three steps needed to use HyGIS.

Users of the source code are strongly encouraged to review these three pages before using the code:

**1.** [**Architecture and workflow**](https://github.com/njadid/HyGIS/wiki/Architecture-and-Workflow)

_Reason: It is important to learn HyGIS rationale before starting to use it. This will save you significant amount of time in future usages._

**2.** [**Supported data types**](https://github.com/njadid/HyGIS/wiki/Supported-data-types)

_Reason: Although the supported data types are among most common data types, there are requirements for data in HyGIS._

**3.** [**Configuration**](https://github.com/njadid/HyGIS/wiki/Configuration)

_Reason: HyGIS configuration plays significant role in relating data to functions embedded in HyGIS. Therefore, understanding Configuration is essential in deploying a working HyGIS web application._
